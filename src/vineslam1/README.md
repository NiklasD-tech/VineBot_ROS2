## <a name="overview"/> Overview

**VineSLAM** is a localization and mapping algorithm designed for challenging agricultural environments such as mountain vineyards and flat orchards.
This algorithm is based on two main performance optimizers: **(1)** topological mapping to manage the memory resources and enable large-scale and long-term operation; and **(2)** CUDA-based GPU optimizations to improve runtime performance.

This algorithm supports two operation modes: **SLAM**, where a multi-layer map is built while the robot is simultaneously localized; and **localization-only**, using a pre-built map to localize the robot.

This implementation is currently supported in **ROS2 Foxy** and **ROS2 Eloquent**.

## <a name="hw_requirements"/> Requirements

### Processing requirements

**VineSLAM** can be executed in **CPU-only** and **GPU-enabled** modes.

To use the GPU optimization, you will need an **NVIDIA**-compatible GPU on your computer.

### Sensors

Mandatory sensors for execution:
- Wheel odometry
- 3D LiDAR

Optional sensors for improved accuracy:
- IMU
- GNSS

**VineSLAM** has been successfully tested with **Velodyne VLP-16**, **Robosense RS-LiDAR-32**, and **Livox**.

**VineSLAM** supports GNSS-based heading input using the Ublox receivers and drivers. Thus, [Ublox ROS package](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/ublox) is a VineSLAM dependency, but it is not mandatory to use.

## <a name="installation"/> Installation

### Dependencies

```
# General dependencies
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev
sudo apt-get install libboost-dev
sudo apt-get install libasio-dev

# ROS dependencies (considering a ros-foxy-full installation)
sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-diagnostic-updater
sudo apt-get install ros-foxy-vision-msgs
```

To use the GPU optimized version, you must **install CUDA**, from [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

### Compilation

Before compiling, a definition should be changed to set the corresponding code for you LiDAR.

To do that, please change the [following line](https://gitlab.inesctec.pt/agrob/vineslam_stack/vineslam/-/blob/master/vineslam_ros/include/vineslam_ros.hpp#L67) in the file [vineslam_ros/include/vineslam_ros.hpp](./vineslam_ros/include/vineslam_ros.hpp) as follows:

````
#define LIDAR_TYPE 0  // for velodyne
#define LIDAR_TYPE 1  // for robosense
#define LIDAR_TYPE 2  // for livox
````

After that, you are ready to compile VineSLAM:

````
cd <path_to_ros2_ws>/src
git clone https://gitlab.inesctec.pt/agrob/vineslam_stack/vineslam -b master
git clone https://github.com/KumarRobotics/ublox -b foxy-devel
cd <path_to_ros2_ws>
colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
````

Note that if you have CUDA installed, VineSLAM will automatically build CUDA kernels and use GPU optimizations.

### Docker

To install and build VineSLAM you can also use the provided [Dockerfile](./docker/Dockerfile).
Note that the Docker environment does not consider CUDA installation.

````
git clone https://gitlab.inesctec.pt/agrob/vineslam_stack/vineslam -b master
cd vineslam/docker
docker build -t vineslam .
````

This will create a docker container with VineSLAM ready to compile and execute. Now you just have to...
````
docker run -it vineslam bash
colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
````

## <a name="ros"/> Configuration

To access the ROS structure implemented by VineSLAM and the parameters tuning, please see the following [README file](./docs/interfaces.md).

## <a name="run"/> How to run

In the [test folder](./test) you can find two folders containing all the necessary files to execute both the SLAM and Localization nodes.

After performing the **topic remappings** and **parameters tuning** you can simply execute, for example the SLAM Node, as follows:

````
cd <path_to_ros2_ws>/src/vineslam/test/test_slam_node
ros2 launch run.launch.py
````

This will automatically open a rviz visualization panel properly configured.

The same can be done for the localization node in the respective test folder.
