                        # - 0: means that you will use the interactive marker that appears on rviz2 to align the local lidar observations (for example, topic "/vineslam/map3D/planars_local") with the global map. This will set the correct robot position inside the map. Once you have it, right-click on top of the interactive market and choose "set pose" option.
                        # - 1: means that vineslam will save the pose that the robot had when you killed the localization_node for the last time. This means that every time you re-launch the localization node it will initialize the robot position from a txt file using the last pose that the robot had when you stopped the program from the last time. This will only work if you do not move the robot from the instant where you stop using the localization node and the one that you started using it again.
                        # - 2: means that vineslam is initializing the robot pose from a fixed pose saved on a txt. Imagine that you launch the localization node and you have the robot always on the same stop on you room or vineyard. This pose is saved on a txt file and loaded everytime.
                        # The first time you use the localization node you should choose the option "0" and initialize it with the interactive marker. Then, you can change it for the option "1" or "2" if you want.
